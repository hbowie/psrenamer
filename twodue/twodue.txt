						 	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	1	9		1.0	GUI Tool for Renaming a Group of Files	Doesn't seem to be a GUI tool for renaming a group of files all in one fell swoop.	Initial release of a new program that will allow the user to rename a group of files all at once. Program has a user-friendly interface and allows one or more sections of the file name to be searched for a matching string, and then will modify the file name in or around the matching string.

						 	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	2	9		1.1	Automatically Increment File Names	However, even after reading the documentation (Help file), I can't figure out what entries I need to put in order to have ALL the files contained in a folder to something else.For example, if my folder has the following:a.txtb.txtc.txtd.txte.txtand I want the final file names to be renamed completely and numbered:mydocs001.txtmydocs002.txtmydocs003.txtmydocs004.txtmydocs005.txt	Added an equals option in the Where column, so that you can look for a matching pattern in the entire file name (minus the extension). For the new equals option only, an asterisk in the Find column will match any value. If you use these two new options together, then the new name you specify will essentially be interpreted as a starting name, and will have its trailing characters incremented by 1 for each successive file renamed. So if you say replace '*' with 'file number 001', then your files will be named 'file number 001', 'file number 002', etc. Similarly, 'file a' would result in 'file a', 'file b', etc.		NA	0	-1	-1

						06/20/2004	00:00 AM	N/A	N/A	3	0		1.3	Added Replace Chars Action		Added a new Action of Replace Chars which, in combination with the Contains option, will treat the Find and New Value strings as individual characters, with each character in the Find string being replaced by the character at the corresponding position in the New Value string. The letter b in the Find string will be interpreted as a blank. A caret ('^') in the New Value string will cause the corresponding character in the Find string to be removed without a replacement.
